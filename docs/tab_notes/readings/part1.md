~*pg 1-73*~ : Mostly index pages, about author, history of java etc  
*pg 74-75*

- These Pages cover the basic principles on Java language is based. it goes on about **process oriented approach** and **object oriented approach**. the former is an approach in which we try to find a solution to a problem based on "How to do it" or "What is happenning" . This is used by languages like C. The latter is an approach in which we try to find a solution by keeping "data" in the center , and based on "who is being affected" . The object oriented approach is considered to be superior to process oriented approach and process oriented approach is considered to get complicated as the code base grows.
- We then jump onto the second principle i.e abstraction. abstraction is about hiding the complexity behind multiple layers of hierarchial classifications and how java utilizes it to be easily maintainable and manageable.

**My Thoughts** : 
- Not completely in agreement with the first point. A bad application of "Data oriented" programming , in my opinion is webdev where we only handle the successful case and ignore the errors/wrong program. a page with malformed html will still run almost perfectly, however it would be pita(pain in the a**) to debug and find the cause of breakage.   
- Completely agree with the second point.I love abstracting code into smaller, testable parts not only does it help hiding complexity, it also helps in seperating the concerns and making code more easy to debug/reuse.
