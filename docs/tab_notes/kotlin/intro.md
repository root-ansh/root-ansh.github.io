# KOTLIN

So, after procrastinating a lot, a have finally decided to learn kotlin.
This will be my safeplace for all the knowledge i gather up around this language, 
as well its use in Android dev.
I have downloaded a bunch of resources and signed up a few courses and my target
is to cover atleast enough to kotlin to make 3-5 production level apps and in 
future get an aad certification for kotlin.

I will be using google docs for making the notes. The mkdocs is causing 
problems with [python 3.8](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/1885) and i 
am unable to view any changes i do unless i deploy them to production. I am 
thinking of adding all my resources in the blogs folder only, providing a github
link for that, but i guess that will make the repo sie very large and cause 
issues in push/pull. So i will be adding them to gdrive and adding them to my 
.ignore lists .Hope mkdocs doesn't break 

(**Update feb 17,20 **: A few posts are with me in my local system, would try to update links here earliest as possible. i am currently looking for a better approach for a website, so i would be either creating one myself{i.e a without using static website frameworks} or using a better blogsite approach {i am having a thought of using reddit for blogging as an idea})
