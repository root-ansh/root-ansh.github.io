shit here without caring much about anyone. You might not wanna read it)

### 29/11/19  

I went to an interview a few days ago, just out of curiousity, even though i was sure that i won't be getting any "android developer jobs" there . it was a mega job fair. in one company, me and my friend neil(fake name) went. the interviewer guy was willing to give neil a package upto 10LPA (its a great offer for freshers in my country) based on his current skills of php js, ... web stuff .  
I had this assumption( and neil did too we both kind off had the same mindset) that a company teaches us things, we just have to be a little famous/accomplished. So i thought why not? i am accomplished. i got 2 apps on playstore, i know a lot of android stuff, i am quite famous. i am equally as deserving as neil.  

But what happenned was something different.  When my turn came, the interviewer said " If you have no knwledge of phy/js/node/angular, why are you sitting here?" to which i said " i presumed company would teach me, since i bring some level of expertise from other fields"  

so he told me some hard truths **"Companies are fast paced. they don't have time to train you in everything. we seek for candidates having some level of knowledge in the domain, so that we could brush up your skills, increase your knowledge to current requirement and push you to production engineer asap, so that you could be worthy of your salary"**  

This is completely correct. i have stuck myself in such a career that its very difficult to sell myself for other job profiles. And from what i have seen, companies seek a very high level of proficiency in this field and rarely recruit freshers( or even if they do, salaries will be aweful). Now i am so unsure about what to do next:  

A.) keep learning more and more of android and look for job in it. And even if am getting an aweful job offer, just sulk and take it
B.) do open source work/gsoc work?( its a good way to earn more recognition/stipend/knowledge and sometimes even job offers)
C.) learn web dev, data sciences, blockchain, cloud or other stuff that i don't yet know
D.) go back to ds algo / competitive? (because having good competitive knowledge is a safe zone. you are assumed as apure fresher with 0 level of practical knowledge but good level of mathemetics)

I know i am going suck in all of the above except maybe (A) or (B) because (C) is something that am unsure would grab my interest (and even if it did, i am sure i need another 1-2 years to be somewhat good at it) and (D) is something i myself know am uncapable of , i am an average shit in maths(but might mug it all up if i pull all nighters for 1 year)

So... i am in a bit of confusion. I cannot dedicate my full time to any company until i graduate in august 2020. But at the same time many companies are offering me good internship opportunities  because i have been doing android for last 2 years. If i go there, i will be doing Android stuff and that's fine by me.  

But  I am kind of done with android. I know what are the things i know and what are the things that i don't. But I feel this learning will never stop and i should have a knowledge of other stuff too. Web dev, Ai,ML ,AR/VR, Security,... stuff  

Answer: Be around android, you know. Android is so full of stuff. learn it. Or simply go around it and learn other stuff "via" android.  
Wanna learn ai/ml? good. learn mlkit, intel's npl library, other stuff , and learn ml whenever needed. wanna learn web? -learn react native/ angular, make android apps.But first learn javascript. like python? learn kiwi  


### 20/10/19 - 6/11/19 
no idea what happenned. some biggies : went to droid con india all alone via FLIGHT!(first time), mom bday, left z1media,... don't remember anymore 


### 8/10/19 -19/10/19  

meh. lots of boring stuff might had happenned, i kinda forgot to update myself here or didn't felt like writing it, whatever.so what happenned last week/weeks? Umm,.. completed office's sdk, pushed it into repo, shown to my manager, got some more bugs to fix, and still working on those. regarding those bugs, my eyes are now tird of looking at exoplayer/tubitv/ima sdk/video view's github issues, group discussions  and SO questions. FUCK this SHIT.  

Other than that, maybe i went to clg someday, some interview in SRM(ooh that was a wickedly adeventures day!3 friends roaming in wild farms in haryana all alnoe with no man is sight for an hour...ooh , chills and thrills!), small fight with bro, office to clg clg to office ,yaada yaada yaada. shit.  

Hey, am thinking moving all my arcghitecture's images to github. fast uploads, easier to access, always available. Know what, that's what we will do 




### 7/10/19
wrote a small article on Android architecture. basically copied some person's full medium article,i am no good at those theory stuff, hehe. I know its bad, i should rather be learning those, but eh. Will do someday when required B).  
Anyways going forward I completed my task at office today, yess! But nobody was there to see it :| mehhhh
I think i am really getting interested in VLC media player. I can try GSOC for that, thing's lit dude .just wrote a mail to them.
oof, their docs say it must be build on linux. hmm, looks like i am in a situtaion but alright, will see to it. VM ftw!  
i really think i have to work on kotlin. When I feel all boasty about how good I am with Android, I kind off forget that I ain't no shit about kotlin X( and that just moves me from 90% topper to 60% average :o ! NOPE, daddy is not gonna go down, Daddy is king! kotlin, i see you: you on my death list now valar morghulis dear X| 

  
### 6/10/19

went to kirtan after so long . it felt so peaceful.Lately i was having some bad thoughts 
regarding a lot of things: aim of life, my losses, my weaknesses , my failures and stuff.
But kirtan is very peaceful, it helps me feel good, think solutions rather than problems.
Couple of thoughts:  
- i am going to continue working in Android for a long time. There are many things that I 
  still need to learn, and there are many milions of devs I am better than them, in terms 
  of knowledge. So I am going to continue working in that. Dont worry about the other 
  stuff ,Ansh . LEt the boasters boast.Android is a vast thing to work upon, if you know
  every tid bits of it, from the tp most layer of apps to the bottommost layer of 
  networking,OS and hardware, you will be valued. plus these blogs are here to share your
  knowledge and get known to people. There will be always someone in need of an 
  android dev and you can be useful then.
  Plus today almost every tech is mergeing with each other. At a point you will be 
  knowing a lot about other things too than just android.  
  <B><U>So Next week, try adding blogs on basic android lifecycles and fragments . Then we will 
  add mini blogs on buttons, switches, tect views and basic ui components(+ all the 
  possible modifications i have ever done to them, for a project).
  Then we will do firebase </B></U>
- Success needs to be celebrated. Not to be boasted in demeaning way , but in a healthy, 
  confidence gaining way. For eg, I got a AAD certiication , i could celebrate in 3 ways:  
  
	- Either i should throw a big party . invite my friends, and discuss only about my aad, 
	  demaining them in beween, like hehe i got aad  you didn't, i earn this much , you don't,
	  ,... etc
	- Or I could throw a small party for my friends abut this, but we discussing 
	  everything else they wanna discuss, with no demaning of anybody involved
	- Or i could just keep quiet about that, and keep working in my home, thinking this 
	  success is small and not worth much and i should wait for a bigger success to throw 
	  a party
  
  I think both 1st and 3rd approach would be wrong. Rather enjoy your moment but don't be 
  an asshole about it

- Bullying anyone is always wrong, even if it is very small or in the name of fun. Never 
  let anyone tell you that you are not worth something or you are a useless person.
  Remember, you--( i had so much to say about this, but i am tired, so forgetting a lot 
  of points).
  Just wanna say that you need to stop being around those who bully you, no matter how 
  much useful those people might be.And also don't stop to to tell people about how really
  you feel, just because it might hurt them, because they don't.  

### 1/10/19 - 5/10/19  

was back to work with full power. able to crack how to run custom ads using video_view.  

Something very terrible happenned . My poor baby cat kiwi passed away on 4th . it was so shocking 
and why the fuck can't I shed tears? Man i have grown emotionless. I am devastated with 
his loss and i want to cry . He was such a cute life living with full health among us. Never even though this 
could happen. He was fine the last night and next morning, mom wake us crying. Turns out 
he got a heart attack due to constipation. These poor souls can't communicate their 
problems and that's what got him :"{

Other than this I was somewhat hyped about gsoc since 1st october. apparently 
Hacktoberfest has made it tough to get tshirts this year. I was also excited about gsoc 
cause that would help me learn. But looks like gsoc is 1 hell of a tough ride:
- People have started as early as september.(not much of a problem but yeah, tough)
- The projects are shit large(not much of a problem but yeah, tough)
- These projects need good knowledge of a topic's language/framework and are not meant to 
  be "learn as you code", they are rather like a challange: "You have to do this, their 
  are a 1000 others who can do the same thing. let's see if you can do this code faster 
  and better than others"
- These projects will need at least 8hr/day or 56hr/week attention and that too in 
  jul/aug/sept2020
- Still though i am going to try for it, currently looking into their code per weekend 
  and let's see if we can make this through

### 30/9/19

Gotta confess, didn't do much stuff. watched a lot of web series( currently it crows and 
futurama) . also checked into popup window and made an issue on prebid repo. 
would check into that later 



### 29/9/19  
SATURDAY! After an ass busting week of papers, i am happy to relax for sometime. 
I didn't applied for leave for today at my office, they are gonna cut the salary, damn :/
Also, fuck i didn't recieved pass for the devfest delhi :'( .  
Anyways today i am continuing my work with exoplayer from the last week, but before that ,

i am in a mood for learning something new : like making this site. i am torn between using
mkdocs, jekyll wordpress or simply html/css .  

- mkdocs is cool, but i still need to run 4 commands and update yaml everytime i add a 
page. It also has a lot of theme limitations and require knowledge of html/css to fix 
them.

- jekyll is also ok, but does not come with a defualy theme, You will have to create 
your own theme in order to make it look nice. but it too had support for external themes.
But again, it had some stuff which needed to be updated manually.

- wordpress is something i am curious about. i heard it is somewhat paid, but a parts of 
  it are free too . it is seen as a very advance version with all those tags and dynamic 
  content support, but also needs html/css/js knowledge for advance customizations

- I don't wanna use html/css because i hate them(Damn, my biggest weakness: why i hate the
most popular type of development in this industry, the web dev? Ugh, i don't know. so much
shit goin on, so many tags, so much sophistication in small stuffs... i had to learn theses
stuff, else i would lag behind... aagh fuck)  

Anyhoo, currently going with this mkdocs theme . did some refactoring in yml file, and 
about to add some general articles.
