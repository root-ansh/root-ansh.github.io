# **Removing the Masks ðŸŽ­**

Weird title, right ? Especially in a time of COVID , a title like this might classify me as insane or a flat-earth conspiracist . 

But fear not, I am neither asking you to remove your masks nor asking you to believe in flat-earth theories. I am just writing some thoughts that have been bothering me for some time which are related to how the modern safety of anonymity is causing us to become more vile and insecure while at the end uncovering some of my *masks* . 

It's always safe to go unnoticed.   

- To be the common( read "ideal") student in a class than rather be that witty guy who would make funny remarks when teacher would say something, bringing the joy in whole class.   
- To be the quiet little in-the-background guy doing the work in job, because once something breaks you don't wanna be the "guy who caused the damage" .  
- To be the cool silent  guy by the corner of drinks counter in a wedding than rather be that drunk boasting dude on Dance floor  
- To be the "devilsBrother69" on reddit and other social media throwing racist comments in posts and chats than rather attach your name and face to it.  
- To be the guy who follows the  religion of majority, who goes where the majority goes, does which majority does. Basically a ***Herd Immunity.***  

The recent pandemic and other lifestyle changes have only added to more frequent usage of Anonymity to represent yourselves to others. We can't visit each other physically but even opening a camera in a meeting is sometimes seen as a taboo. And human brain takes a different wild form when it realizes that no one is watching. Just from a harmless yoga pants while working from home to spreading hate on social media under some pseudo-identity , one can reach different levels of vileness.

## Not all masks are bad.
Sometimes it's necessary to wear the cloak of invisibility as being identifiable will do more damage than good. for eg,   
- you would think twice to share your Addresses , phone number and identity cards info to various websites for the obvious reason that they could use this for  powering  malicious motives.   
- You would create 2 public and work profiles on various platforms to keep the associated audience from overlapping as neither would benefit knowing the others : Your aunts and uncles might judge you for the company/product you work upon, while your potential recruiters and companies might judge you for the personal life you have.    
- (Even your company doesn't want you to be representing your work as yours but rather the company, that might be why the first thing they do while you join is give you a different email ID (just kidding))  

## Uncovering the masks : to do or not to do, is the question?

So far I have tried to address both sides of a coin with an unbiased opinion. Having a mask  of anonymity is both a good thing a bad thing, and it mainly depends on you for how you use that mask.  

But what about removing this anonymity ? Should you do it? would it be useful ? Is someone already doing it ? I can no longer be unbiased anymore, as this thing has been bothering me for sometime and I personally feel that not having an *absolute*  cloak of invisibility over me might be  more beneficial.

1. I am obviously not going to go out post my bank details or voter id card numbers. However some people have done some crazy [social experiments](https://twitter.com/championswimmer/status/1381193497764634624?s=20)  with positive results.(Disclaimer: Try at your own risk)  So I would take the moral of the story to be confident, a little crazy and open enough to raise your thoughts for who you are , rather than being an invisible eye watching the whole world burning itself down.  
2. The sense of confidence that you get , when you are true, same person everywhere is something the goes long way for helping you get comfortable. You don't have to awkwardly accept drinks and food that you don't like if you remain firm on your stances than rather stumbling down over the peer pressure.  
3. Attaching a profile on your posts and comments makes you responsible for those actions. People would look at your face and trust you, judge you, respect you or hate you for such thoughts. Thus I think this is a step towards improving your own thoughts as they are getting criticised publicly and correctly.  
4. Expressing yourself is the key to be happy. If you think something is wrong , express your concern. If you think something is funny, laugh it out. If you think something is making you uncomfortable, let it be known to the associated authorities (friends , family coworkers , etc) Keeping your thoughts to yourself sometimes causes a regret that could be avoided by just being a little open.  
5. Stop using **"Trying"** often.  "Trying" is a phase, it has a beginning and an end. The act of "trying" is itself a mask on its own . "I am trying to become a better person" , "I am trying to learn this tech" , ... well OK!! what is your current state? when is this trial phase ending ? Every "trying" should come with a deadline. like , "i have been trying to lose weight for last 4 months and i have lost 6 pounds" or  "I tried doing yoga every day in January, but i could not attend more than 15 sessions, so I left it" Be firm about your action related to "trying"

## Hello World .

It would be a little hypocritical of me to write an article on anonymity without telling a little about myself. So here goes nothing. 

- I am an Indian, Delhi-based guy in his 20s working as an Android Engineer in an ed-tech startup and learning various tools and technologies along the way . Over the last few years, I have achieved fluency as a Associate Engineer in making mobile apps and now am trying to gain more senior level skills (with a goal of  next 1 year)
- Personally am an animal lover,  vegetarian and simplistic guy with curiosities and dreams to travel distant places . I have been to some valleys of nanital and jammu . Our home always has some adopted cats or kittens running around.
- I am a follower of [Shri Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar (also known as Anandmurti or Baba)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prabhat_Ranjan_Sarkar)  as religion. He was a great spiritual guru , a philosopher and a composer of 1000s of folk songs . Some of the teachings that a strict follower of  Shri Shri Anandamurti does are: 
    - Doing Exercise and Asanas twice a day
    - Eating "Satvik" food:  Plant based food with simple flavours , low calories and avoiding foods that have a sedative effect on the mind and body (like onion, garlic , mushrooms , meat etc)
    - keeping yourself fresh, clean , doing monthly fasting, the practise of meditation and ultimate surrender to a supreme power, self realisation and service to all , ... and many more . you can read more about him [here](https://www.anandamarga.org/about/founder/) 


There are many more masks that I might like to uncover, but  they might be suited for a better time.

With love,
Ansh
