# My Travel Stories

> I love to travel! I want to visit a lot of places, see the various cultures and sights, interact with people and have fun.   


However this is a bit hypocritical statement as of now üòÖ  . Being a single child from an  over protective family with struggling finances meant that I ended up being a [frog of a well](http://chinese-story-collection.blogspot.com/2010/09/frog-in-well.html) . I wasn't allowed to go for school picnics, nor i took any far off tutions, or a hostel in college. I didn't learn to drive and our family rarely ever went for a journey outside our state( there were neither much finances nor any interest for going out)  


So I am trying to change all of this. I am learning to drive, and i try to go places on my own. I am still a conservative introvert, but I don't shy away from  connecting with strangers and am always up for a tech event or community gathering. I have different social circles of friends which makes plans for trips from time to time and sometimes those actually get implemented too üòÇ.
